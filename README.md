# 📊 COVID-19 Data Analysis Using OWID Dataset

A comprehensive data analysis and visualization project using the **Our World In Data (OWID)** COVID-19 dataset. The project explores the spread, death rate, and vaccination progress across selected countries, uncovering key trends and insights.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Clean and preprocess the COVID-19 dataset for analysis.
* Compare pandemic trends across Kenya, the USA, and India.
* Visualize the progression of total cases, new cases, deaths, and vaccinations.
* Investigate correlations between features like testing, deaths, and vaccinations.
* Derive insights regarding death rates and vaccination coverage globally.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

* **Python**
* **Pandas** – data loading and manipulation
* **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** – for data visualization
* **NumPy** – numerical operations
* **Jupyter Notebook** – analysis environment

## ▶️ How to Run / View the Project

1. **Download or clone** this repository.
2. Ensure you have Python 3 and the required libraries installed.
3. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   cd path/to/your/project-folder
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/techwakanda/owid-covid-19-data.git
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - COVID-19 analysis project"
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

4. Open the analysis notebook (`COVID_Analysis.ipynb` or similar) and run the cells sequentially.
5. Make sure the file `owid-covid-data.csv` is in the same directory.

## 📌 Key Insights & Reflections

* The **USA** had the highest total COVID-19 cases as per the dataset's latest records.
* Countries like **Portugal** and **UAE** achieved over **90% vaccination rates**.
* **Yemen** and **Haiti** showed alarming death rates despite fewer reported cases — possibly due to underreporting and poor healthcare systems.
* A correlation heatmap showed a strong relationship between **total cases**, **deaths**, and **new cases**.
* Some countries with high case numbers had low vaccination rates, highlighting inequity in vaccine access.
* Cleaning the dataset posed challenges due to extensive missing data, particularly in African nations.
